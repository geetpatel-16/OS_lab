Que- 1
	Output:
		 using fork() where parent process was executing first.

Parent sees i = 0 
Parent sees i = 1 
Child sees i = 0 
Child sees i = 1 
Parent sees i = 2 
Child sees i = 2 
		
		using vfork() where child process is schedule first.

Child sees i = 0 
Parent sees i = 0 
Child sees i = 1 
Parent sees i = 1 
Child sees i = 2 
Parent sees i = 2 

Que-2 
	Output 

	Parent says a: 1 
	id: 2 a: 2 b: 1 
	id: 1 a: 2 b: 1
Here threads are not joining because of wile loop.

Que-3
	a) For m user-level threads and n kernel-level threads, 
	m>>n , m>n and m(approx)=n mappings are a possibility. 
	Since if m<n or m<<n which means there are n available kernel threads assigned to m user-level      threads which are less. Now if user level threads are less, then why would we need more kernel level threads. 

	b)The best choice would be m>n.
